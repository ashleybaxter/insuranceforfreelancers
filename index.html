<h3>How Does Business Insurance Affect You As A Freelancer?</h3>

<p>Business is unpredictable, but insurance provides a financial buffer to deal with every situation. Clients can have faith in your business knowing you'll be able to continue to deliver even if something bad happens.</p>

<p>In fact, in the UK you can't contract for some businesses unless you have professional indemnity insurance.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of cover you choose, business insurance can protect you from financial loss due to negligent mistakes, copyright or trademark infringement, cases of injury or illness to employees or clients and much more.</p>

<p>What cover you want will depend on the services you offer, so let's break it down.</p>

<h3>Professional Indemnity Insurance</h3>

<p>Professional indemnity is the most popular cover for freelancers to have. In a nutshell, it's there to protect you in case you make a careless mistake.</p>

<p>You may have seen this referred to as <em>"Oops, I screwed up and now I'm being sued"</em> insurance, which sounds about right!</p>

<p>The biggest cause of claims against freelancers working within design is copyright infringement. Professional indemnity covers legal action levelled against you for copyright or trademark infringement, so it's a popular cover amongst freelance web and graphic designers.</p>

<p>However, professional indemnity covers you for much more, such as mistakes you make in your work a client claims has caused them loss of income.</p>

<p>This is particularly important if you provide advice or a service to your client, which most freelancers do. A client may perceive your advice or service to have caused them loss of income.</p>

<p>Some freelance professions that would benefit from professional indemnity include; consultants, web developers or designers, photographers, illustrators, copywriters.</p>

<h3>But I Have A Bulletproof Contract</h3>

<p>Yes, you have a contract. It's rock solid and hasn't failed you yet. However, you're not immune from a client taking legal action against you just because you work with a contract, and professional indemnity covers the legal fees, even if you lose the case and are in the wrong.</p>

<h3>Public Liability Insurance</h3>

<p>Public liability isn't as popular a choice for freelancers as professional indemnity, but depends entirely on where you work from and how often you interact with clients or members of the public.</p>

<p>Basically, if a client is on the property you conduct your business from—even if that's your home—you are now liable for them and their wellbeing. If they suffer injury or illness, you are responsible for that. This is a scary thought if a client sustains an injury on your property which prevents them from working, requiring compensation from <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>Public liability also covers you on client premises. It's not just for injury or illness to people, but also damage to property. You know, if you damage a client's computer and are liable for the repair cost.</p>

<p>Again, whether you need this depends on where you work from. If you work exclusively from home and deal with all clients remotely, you probably don't need public liability insurance. A photographer, on the other hand, who is on location and interacting with people regularly, would be mistaken to forgo public liability.</p>

<h3>Employers' Liability Insurance</h3>

<p>Freelancers often team up with other people to compliment their skill-set. For example, a designer may hire a front-end developer to bring their clients' designs to life. Even if it's a temporary or part-time arrangement, you're legally obligated to have employers' liability insurance.</p>

<p>Employers' liability isn't too dissimilar to public liability insurance, covering injury or illness caused to your employees as a result of work.</p>

<p>If you're employing your friends and working from home, you're still required by law to have cover of at least £5 million. Each day you go without can incur a hefty fine.</p>

<h3>Other Types Of Cover</h3>

<p>Those are the three key covers, but other types of business insurance include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Business contents (equipment, office supplies etc)</li>
	<li>Business interruption (covers loss of income if business temporarily closes due to disaster)</li>
	<li>Business property (covers physical office premises)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mix And Match</h3>

<p>Because business insurance isn't a 'one size fits all' solution, most insurers offering cover for freelancers enable you to pick and choose which covers you need, all under one policy.</p>

<p>So, start building your policy today. For as little as £100 per annum, you can sleep easy at night knowing you've got it covered.</p>
